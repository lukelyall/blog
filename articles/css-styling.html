              <p class="sub-title">Introduction</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                There are a lot of standards on how CSS should by styled and structured, all with benefits 
                and drawbacks. I found it difficult to follow one folder structure completely, so I made
                my own CSS structure for modularity and easy readability for others. My CSS file structure 
                splits the main CSS into six folders: setup, theme, interactables, elements, components, and review 
                with one master CSS file.

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Folder Structure</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                This is my current folder structure: <br>
                /css/<br>
                |- 1.setup<br>
                |- 2.theme<br>
                |- 3.interactables<br>
                |- 4.elements<br>
                |- 5.components<br>
                |- 6.review<br>
                |_ master.css<br>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Setup</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                The first folder, 1.setup, is for the basic general settings of the project and the 
                layers file. If you are unfamiliar with the @layer feature of CSS, I would recommend 
                reading this 
                <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="sub-text">@layer documentation</a>. 
                <br>Setup's file structure:<br>
                |- 1.setup<br>
                |&emsp;|- base.css<br>
                |&emsp;|_ layers.css<br>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Theme</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                The 2.theme folder is for setting up variables, any styles that change the visuals of 
                the site such as background color or text color, and media queries. 
                <br>Theme's file structure:<br>
                |- 2.theme<br>
                |&emsp;|- config.css<br>
                |&emsp;|- display.css<br>
                |&emsp;|_ media-queries.css<br>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Interactables</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                The third folder, 3.interactables, is for anything a user interacts with such as buttons and 
                sliders.
                <br>Interactable's file structure<br>
                |- 3.interactables<br>
                |&emsp;|_ button.css<br>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Elements</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                The 4.elements folder is for how HTML elements without classes are going to look. This is 
                different from the 1.setup folder because it focuses on HTML elements like the spacing of the divs
                and not the generic CSS setup.
                <br>Element's file structure:<br>
                |- 4.elements<br>
                |&emsp;|- div.css<br>
                |&emsp;|- footer.css<br>
                |&emsp;|- header.css<br>
                |&emsp;|_ section.css<br>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Components</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                The fifth folder, 5.components, is for elements that need special classes for appearance. This can include 
                CSS for items such as quote blocks, images, or text blocks.
                <br>Components' file structure:<br>
                |- 5.components<br>
                |&emsp;|- image-card.css<br>
                |&emsp;|- text-block.css<br>
                |&emsp;|_ quote-block.css<br>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Review</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                The sixth folder, 6.review, should be the least used folder and is for CSS that works, but how it was made is 
                sketchy so it needs another pair of eyes or to be revisited later.
                <br>Review's file structure:<br>
                |- 6.review<br>
                |&emsp;|_ fix-me.css<br>
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">Master File</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                Finally, the master.css file is where all the layers are combined. This file imports all the layers and their 
                respective files and is the one file added to the script tag in the HTML.
                <br>This file will look something like this:
                <code>
                  /* master css file */<br><br>
                  @import url("1.setup/font.css");<br>
                  @import url("1.setup/base.css");<br><br>
                  &emsp;@import url("2.theme/config.css");<br>
                </code>
                That's the whole structure. This file structure has helped me keep my CSS clean and allowed for easier readability for
                others. Everybody likes to use their own way of structuring CSS, but I hope that this helped to give an idea on what
                you may want to do with your own CSS files.
