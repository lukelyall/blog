                I had previously used Microsoft Word for editing and formatting my resume, but have recently come to appreciate
                LaTeX and its ability to create professional looking documents easily. If you're unfamiliar with LaTeX, it is simply a 
                document-production application that relies on commands similar to HTML and markdown.

            <section>
              <p class="sub-title">LaTeX Basic Syntax Example</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                <code>
                  \documentclass{article}<br>
                  \begin{document}<br>
                  First document. This is a simple example, with no <br>
                  extra parameters or packages included.<br>
                  \end{document}<br>
                </code>
                This simple example shows a few different formatting requirements in LaTeX including the
                documentclass, begin, and end tags. \documentclass{article} defines what type of document you are 
                making (in this case an article) and bases the overall appearance of the document on this tag. 
                For example, a document with \documentclass{article} will look different than a document with 
                \documentclass{resume}. Next, the \begin{document} and \end{document} are used to store the entire 
                contents of the current document.

              <p class="sub-title">Creating a Resume</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                Now to create a resume, you will use all of the tags previously mentioned tags along with some new ones.
                First, set the document class to resume with:
                <code>
                  \documentclass{resume}
                </code>
                After that, you can decide if there are any packages you want to use for your resume. Two packages that I suggest 
                are font packages and hypperref (used for creating links). For arial font and the use of hypperrefs do the following:
                <code>
                  \usepackage{helvet}<br>
                  \renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}<br>
                  \usepackage[colorlinks=true, urlcolor=blue, linkcolor=red]{hyperref}
                </code>

                With the setup complete, you can setup the header of your resume which typically consists of your name, contact information, 
                and location. This all can be setup easily with the following lines:
                <code>
                  \name{Your Name}<br><br>
                  \address{(xxx)~$\cdot$~xxx~$\cdot$~xxxx \: \href{mailto:email@email.com}{email@email.com} \: Anchorage, Alaska}
                </code>
                This adds two lines one with your name and another with your phone, email, and location. The \: is used to put spaces 
                between each bit of personal information, but the \: could be changed out for another spacing item such as dashes. 
                Now the header is completed with basic information and we can move onto the full document with the command:
                <code>
                  \begin{document}
                </code>
                Next, we can create sections for information about yourself to do this you will use the following style:
                <code>
                  \begin{rSection}{Experience}<br><br>
                  &emsp;\begin{rSubsection}{Work Location}{May 2023 - August 2023}{Work Title}{Anchorage, AK}<br>
                  &emsp;&emsp;\item Lorem ipsum <br>
                  \end{rSubsection}<br>
                </code>
                This creates a new section titled Experience and throws in a work position with bullet points underneath. For my resume, 
                I followed this style for all my sections with minor changes made in each section for different styling such as removing 
                bullet points.<br><br>
                And that's the basics of using LaTeX for a resume. If creating a resume from scratch seems too complex, there are many great templates 
                that do everything I have shown here already. If using a template, I'd advise that you take time to understand the basics of LaTeX 
                and how to make design changes to your resume. LaTeX may not be easier than Word for everybody so use whatever you are most comfortable with.
