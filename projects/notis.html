                Notis is a private messenger that uses the 
                <a href="https://nostr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-link">Nostr</a> 
                protocol and was built with the React Native framework. Notis allows for private communication without 
                having to input personal information (makes use of public and private keys). This project served as my
                 capstone project for my final year of college and was developed by

              <p class="sub-title">Development</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                Notis went through many design changes as the project progressed due to various difficulties 
                (<a href="#challenges">Challenges section</a>) including switching frameworks. Originally, Notis 
                was built as a web application in React, but the need for a mobile Nostr application was more
                prevalent, so we decided to switch to the React Native framework. The development of the project
                itself was split amongst us with my focus being on encrypting and decrypting messages, setting up 
                the login page and functionality, and assisting others in problems that arose as they worked.

              <p class="text-block">
                Notis utilizes the Nostr protocol with secure private and public key communication. Users 
                are able to log into Notis with an existing public and private key or by creating a key pair
                upon entering the application. Users are able to contact other users via their public key and
                can also add public keys to contacts. Contacts can be assigned a nickname, deleted, and/or blocked
                by a user at anytime.

              <p class="text-block">
                The biggest challenge of Notis was using the Nostr protocol as it is a newer protocol and lacks
                good documentation. A lot of problems with the development of this application were because of 
                insufficient documentation and incomplete tools.

              <p class="text-block">
                This project taught me how to work on a team, adapting the Agile workflow, and to write clear and 
                concise documentation. It also taught me a lot about web development and mobile application development.
