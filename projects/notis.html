                protocol and developed using the React Native framework. It allows for private communication without 
                having to input personal information., employing both public and private keys for security This project served as the
                 capstone project for my final year of college and was collaboratively developed by

              <p class="text-block">
                Notis underwent several design iterations during its development, largely due to challenges such as  
                framework transitions. Originally, Notis was built as a web application in React, but we later
                identified a stronger demand for a mobile Nostr application. Due to this, we pivoted to the React Native framework. 
                In terms of development, our roles were divided, with my primary contributions focusing on message encryption
                and decryption, developing the login page and its functionality, and to provide support to the others as they
                encountered challenges.

              <p class="text-block">
                Notis employs the Nostr protocol, ensuring secure communication through private and public key encryption. 
                Upon entering Notis, users can either log in using an existing key pair or generate a new one. Communication
                between users is established using public keys, which can be added to contacts if desired. Additionally, users
                can assign nicknames, delete, or block contacts as needed.

              <p class="text-block">
                The biggest challenge we faced while developing Notis was implementing the Nostr protocol, due to
                it being a newer protocol with limited documentation. Many development issues came from improper and
                inadequate documentation and incomplete tools advertised as complete tools.

              <p class="text-block">
                This project provided many valuable lessons especially in teamwork, adapting to the Agile workflow,
                and creating clear and concise documentation. On top of that, it significantly enhanced my skills in 
                both web development and mobile application development.
