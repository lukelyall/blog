              <p class="text-block">
                This program integrates audio processing with Python's PyAudio library. It detects guitar notes through Fourier analysis and maps each detected 
                note to a keyboard input. This allows the guitar to act as a keyboard, turning played notes into key presses.

              <p class="text-block">
                This project was created using Python and the PyAudio library. THe project helped me learn more about processing audio and differentiating 
                different noises with Python.

              <p class="text-block">
                The application prints to the command line the noise frequency and the key that it presses based off the noise.

              <p class="sub-title">Challenges</p>
              <p class="text-block">
                There were not really any challenges in this project. An interesting implementation I have is an array that takes the most commonly heard frequency in a second 
                and chooses that as the key to press; this was because my microphone picks up so many different noises that it's easier to listen for a second and then choose the 
                most common frequency rather than accepting every noise.

              <p class="text-block">
                From this project, I learned more about processing and working with audio in Python.
