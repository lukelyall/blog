              <p class="text-block">
                Create a program that, when given a message from a file and an integer key, encrypts the message by adding the ASCII number for each character to 
                the character's index and to the key and then converts that sum to binary.<br><br>
                The program should also be able to decrypt any encrypted messages it creates.<br><br>
                Try to make the program as fast as possible in the language of your choice.

                I completed this project in three different languages: C++, C#, and Python. C# was the fastest of the three and Python 
                was obviously the slowest. C# was able to encrypt the entire KJV Bible with a key value of 97 in less than two seconds; encryption took 0.778 seconds and 
                decryption took 1.12 seconds.

                The application asks the user what file they want to encrypt and what file to decrypt as well what key value to use for encryption and decryption.

                There were not really any challenges in this project. This was just a fun challenge to try and make an efficient encryption and decryption program 
                in different languages.

                From this project, I learned more about encrypting and decrypting files in different languages.
